# OpenCV-Fundamentals--Image-Processing-&-Computer-Vision

This project demonstrates **image processing and computer vision fundamentals** using **OpenCV and NumPy**, organized into a clean and professional workflow.  
It highlights essential techniques such as color spaces, pixel manipulation, geometric transforms, thresholding, edge detection, drawing, and visualization — forming the **core foundation for advanced computer vision and AI projects**.

---

## 📌 Why This Project

Many OpenCV examples show only small code snippets.  
This project is designed as a **comprehensive, structured implementation** that demonstrates:

- Image handling with OpenCV and NumPy.
- Channel manipulations and color space conversions.
- Core preprocessing techniques like blurring, thresholding, and morphology.
- Edge detection, filters, and histogram visualization.
- Basic geometric operations and shape drawing.
- Interactive OpenCV callbacks for local experimentation.

---

## ✨ Highlights

- Hands-on exploration of **OpenCV & NumPy fundamentals**.
- Organized into logical sections for step-by-step learning.
- Demonstrates both **basic and intermediate CV techniques**.
- Provides practical examples with real images.

## 📖 Contents

- **Section 1:** Image loading, inspection, and visualization.
- **Section 2:** Synthetic image creation using NumPy.
- **Section 3:** Color channels (R, G, B) and color space conversions (HSV).
- **Section 4:** Pixel slicing and channel isolation.
- **Section 5:** Geometric transforms (resize, crop, rotate, flip).
- **Section 6:** Thresholding, morphological operations, and Canny edge detection.
- **Section 7:** Drawing shapes (rectangles, triangles, circles).
- **Section 8:** Convolution filters, Sobel edges, and color histograms.
- **Section 9:** Interactive drawing with mouse callbacks (local GUI run).
